<p class="def">
Aeronautics is the study of the science of flight. Aeronautics is the method of designing an airplane or other flying machine. There are four basic areas that aeronautical engineers must understand in order to be able to design planes. To design a plane, engineers must understand all of these elements. </p>
<br>
<h2 id="class1">Design Process</h2>
<p class="simp">1 Aerodynamics. is the study of how air flows around the airplane. By studying the way air flows around the plane the engineers can define the shape of the plane. <br>The wings, the tail, and the main body or fuselage of the plane all affect the way the air will move around the plane.<br>

2. Propulsion. is the study of how to design an engine that will provide the thrust that is needed for a plane to take off and fly through the air.<br> The engine provides the power for the airplane.<br> The study of propulsion is what leads the the engineers determine the right kind of engine and the right amount of power that a plane will need.<br>

3. Materials and Structures. is the study of what materials are to be used on the plane and in the engine and how those materials make the plane strong enough to fly effectively. <br>The choice of materials that are used to make the fuselage wings, tail and engine will affect the strength and stability of the plane. Many airplane materials are now made out of composites, materials that are stronger than most metals and are lightweight.<br>

4. Stability and Control.<br> is the study of how to control the speed, direction, altitude and other conditions that affect how a plane flies.<br> The engineers design the controls that are needed in order to fly and instruments are provided for the pilot in the cockpit of the plane.<br> The pilot uses these instruments to control the stability of the plane during flight.<br>

Main article:<br> Aerospace engineering<br>
Aeronautical engineering covers the design and construction of aircraft, including how they are powered, how they are used and how they are controlled for safe operation.[19]<br><br>

A major part of aeronautical engineering is aerodynamics, the science of passing through the air.<br>

With the increasing activity in space flight, nowadays aeronautics and astronautics are often combined as aerospace engineering.<br>

Aerodynamics<br>
Main article: Aerodynamics<br>
The science of aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.<br>

The study of aerodynamics falls broadly into three areas:<br>

Incompressible flow occurs where the air simply moves to avoid objects, typically at subsonic speeds below that of sound (Mach 1).<br>

Compressible flow occurs where shock waves appear at points where the air becomes compressed, typically at speeds above Mach 1.<br>

Transonic flow occurs in the intermediate speed range around Mach 1, where the airflow over an object may be locally subsonic at one point and locally supersonic at another.<br>

Launch of Apollo 15 Saturn V rocket: T – 30 s through T + 40 s.<br>
A rocket or rocket vehicle is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle which obtains thrust from a rocket engine. In all rockets, the<br> exhaust is formed entirely from propellants carried within the rocket before use.[20] Rocket engines work by action and reaction. Rocket engines<br> push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.<br>

Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century China.[21] Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology of the Space Age, including setting foot on the moon.
<br>
Rockets are used for fireworks, weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles for artificial satellites, human spaceflight and exploration of other planets. While comparatively inefficient for low speed use, they are very lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining extremely high speeds with reasonable efficiency.<br>

Chemical rockets are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of rocket propellant. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.<br>

<h2 id="class1">Cayley and the foundation of modern aeronautics</h2>
<p class="simp">
Sir George Cayley (1773–1857) is widely acknowledged as the founder of modern aeronautics. He was first called the "father of the aeroplane" in 1846[16] and Henson called him the "father of aerial navigation."[3] He was the first true scientific aerial investigator to publish his work, which included for the first time the underlying principles and forces of flight.[17]

In 1809 he began the publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled "On Aerial Navigation" (1809–1810).[18] In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, "The whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air." He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: thrust, lift, drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs.

He developed the modern conventional form of the fixed-wing aeroplane having a stabilising tail with both horizontal and vertical surfaces, flying gliders both unmanned and manned.

He introduced the use of the whirling arm test rig to investigate the aerodynamics of flight, using it to discover the benefits of the curved or cambered aerofoil over the flat wing he had used for his first glider. He also identified and described the importance of dihedral, diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of ornithopters and parachutes.[3]

Another significant invention was the tension-spoked wheel, which he devised in order to create a light, strong wheel for aircraft undercarriage.
